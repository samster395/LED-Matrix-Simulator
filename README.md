Check it out [here](https://samster395.github.io/LED-Matrix-Simulator/).

I was too impatient waiting for my [Scroll pHAT HD](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-phat-hd) to arrive so I created a simulator for it.

It can be customised for any matrix size and has support for animations.

It is useful to see what things will look like without writing any code.
